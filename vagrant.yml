# Sync folders configuration
synced_folders:
    # nfs: better performance on Mac, recommended.
    # rsync: the best performance, cross-platform platform, one-way only. Run `vagrant rsync-auto` to start auto sync.
    #   When using rsync sync type the "folders" list below is mandatory.
    # vboxfs (or leave empty): best compatibility and ease of setup, but poor performance.
    type: 'nfs'
    # List of folders to sync with rsync. These should be subfolder names within the <Projects> folder (e.g. "drupal7")
    # Uncomment and add folders per the example below as neccessary.
    # Note: you'll have to run `vagrant rsync-auto` in the background to keep the files in sync as you make changes
    folders:
      #- "projectA"  # rsync projectA folder
      #- "projectB"  # rsync projectB folder
      #- ""  # rsync the whole <Projects> folder. WARNING: don't do this if your <Projects> folder is big.

# The default box private network IP is 192.168.10.10
# Uncomment lines below to map additional IP addresses for use with multiple projects.
# Project specific `<IP>:<port>` mapping for containers is done in via docker-compose in `docker-compose.yml`
